# Horiseon

Refactoring an existing marketing agency's site to make it more user accessible. 

## Objective

My Objective with this project was to add symantic elemants to the html to make this website more user acessible. I wanted to make sure every reader was able to understand and differentiate the different types of information provided. I also wanted to structure the contents of the page so it easier to edit and style.
